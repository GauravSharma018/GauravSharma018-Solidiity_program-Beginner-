# GauravSharma018-Solidiity_program-Beginner-
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity. The contract has multiple functions(i.e. burn and mint) that performs different tasks(i.e. increment and decrement). This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
